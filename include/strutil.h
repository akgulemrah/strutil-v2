/*
 * strutil.h - String Utility Functions
 *
 * This header file provides a set of functions for manipulating and managing
 * strings in a thread-safe manner. The `str` structure allows for dynamic
 * string management with support for various operations such as adding,
 * modifying, and querying string data.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Dynamic memory management for string data.
 * - Thread safety through mutex locking.
 * - Functions for common string operations like conversion, reversal, and
 *   manipulation.
 *
 * The functions provided in this header file include:
 * - `str_init()`: Initialize a new `Str` structure.
 * - `str_add()`: Append a string to the existing data.
 * - `str_input()`: Read a string from standard input.
 * - `str_add_input()`: Append input from standard input to existing data.
 * - `str_pop_back()`: Remove trailing data after a specified separator.
 * - `str_print()`: Print the string data to standard output.
 * - `str_get_size()`: Get the length of the string.
 * - `str_clear()`: Clear the string data.
 * - `str_free()`: Free the `Str` structure and its associated resources.
 * - `str_rem_word()`: Remove a specified word from the string.
 * - `str_swap_word()`: Swap occurrences of two words in the string.
 * - `str_to_upper()`: Convert the string to uppercase.
 * - `str_to_lower()`: Convert the string to lowercase.
 * - `str_to_title_case()`: Convert the string to title case.
 * - `str_reverse()`: Reverse the string.
 * - `str_is_empty()`: Check if the string is empty.
 * - `get_dyn_input()`: Helper function to read input dynamically.
 *
 * This file includes necessary headers for standard operations and thread safety,
 * and defines the `Str` structure along with associated function prototypes.
